SQON - Structured Query Object Notation (Delwink C Implementation)

Query SQL databases with a JSON API. Current target: MySQL.

This is Delwink's C implementation of SQON. For the format itself, see
[Delwink's website][3].

Why SQON?
---------

The purpose of SQON is simple: to make interaction with SQL databases as easy
as any JSON API. So many languages interact flawlessly with JSON for data
transfer as well as (clearly) object notation.

This was created as a replacement for [cquel][1] that would make for an easier
library to wrap in the Python 3 language, which supports JSON objects in its
standard library. This replacement offers a far simpler API, and this provides
an environment less prone to bugs and memory leaks on the C side, making a
portable and stable library implementation.

See [INSTALL](INSTALL) for instructions on building and installing libsqon.

Hacking
-------

libsqon uses the GNU coding style for C, and follows a strict 80-column limit
in its source code. Indentations are two spaces, and tab characters are eight
spaces. It is polite to use a tab character any time eight spaces would be
used, but not required.
