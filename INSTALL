Installing libsqon
==================

Before installing libsqon, one must satisfy its runtime and build dependencies.

| Library            | Purpose                                    |
|--------------------+--------------------------------------------|
| Jansson            | JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) support. |
| MySQL (or MariaDB) | Support for the MySQL database engine.     |

Installing the Dependencies
---------------------------

On GNU/Linux, one usually installs required libraries using a package
manager. These differ between distributions; we have below the example for
Debian GNU/Linux and derivatives (such as Trisquel).

    # apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake
    # apt-get install libjansson-dev libmariadb-client-lgpl-dev

Building libsqon
----------------

libsqon follows the GNU build process, using the autotools. Execute the
following commands in the root directory of the source distribution.

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make

Installing libsqon
------------------

The most basic install can be done with GNU make.

    # make install

A safer installation can be done using a tool called checkinstall.

    # checkinstall

If using checkinstall, you may want to add `--prefix=/usr` when executing
`./configure` to install the library to the usual directories on a GNU/Linux
system.
